    <h1>Idiomatic Speech Patterns.</h1>
    <p>Some idiomatic speech patters may also be classed as idioms as there is no clear dividing line between them.  Remember to include one or two idiomatic speech patterns in your writing and speaking exams for level 7 and above. Do not use them in graph descriptions and formal essays.  It is possible to use some in these, but knowing which ones are acceptable and which ones are not, and in what context is a native speaker skill.</p>
