    <p>The IELTS reading test will assess you on three reading skills, skimming, reading for understanding and scanning.</p>  
    It is important to practice all these skills on each article you read, and in the same order, ie. first skim, then read for understanding and then scan.</p> 		
    <h2>Skimming</h2>
    <p>To do this, first read the title and any subtitles, then the introduction and summary at the end. 
    Then read the first and last lines of each paragraph quickly,looking only for the main points.  
    The object is get a good overview of the subject and structure/framework of the essay.  
    Skimming should be very quick, reading a line at a time, and not a word at a time.</p>
    <h2>Reading for Understanding</h2>
    <p>Read the whole text, putting the information into the framework you have in your mind after skimming.</p>
    <h2>Scanning</h2>
    <p>This is done to obtain specific information from the text.  
    Pick out the key words from the question, and scan the text to look for them by viewing large sections of text, 
    if you have already skimmed and read for detail, you will usually know which paragraph the keyword can be found because the information is in a framework in your mind. Underline the keyword so that if you have time to check your answers, you can easily find it.
    Some questions may not have keywords, but be paraphrased. In this case you need to establish what the keyword might be, or where in
    the text the answer may be found. As the questions get progressively more difficult, these questions will usually be closer to the end.</p>  
    <p>Remember to use the end of your pen and run it down the lines of text as you read.  It is scientifically proven that this speeds up your reading speed.<br><br></p>
    <p>There are 40 questions to answer and about 2000 words to read, sometimes more.</p>
    <p>As with all exams, if you have difficulty with an answer, don't waste time on it, answer the next and go back to it later.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, most students do not prepare for this test and consequently fail to complete it within the allotted time at their first attempt.</p>
