<p>My name is Steven, I am a community tutor on italki, welcome to my home page.</p>
<p>The purpose of this site is to provide the necessary information and help to students who wish to try the IELTS exam and need to obtain a band score of up to 7.5; it assumes a knowledge of English up to band score 5.5. Unfortunately it is not fully developed yet, but I am working on it. If there is anything in particular you would like to see on the site, please contact me via italki, the online platform I use for teaching. The link is below; I will do my best to accommodate you.</p>

<p> There is a huge demand for the IELTS test at the moment, mainly from people who wish to emigrate to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland, all of which require immigrants to prove their knowledge of English. I am pleased to say that many of my former students are now enjoying their lives in these countries. If you would like to join them, I will be pleased to help you.</p>

<p>New students often inquire as to how long it will take them to go up one band level, but unfortunately it is a difficult question because students vary in their aptitude, commitment and the time they have available for study. However, typically, I would say that a fully committed student of average aptitude and plenty of time to study, having two lessons a week, will take an average of nine months to go from 5.5 to 6.5. From 6.5 to 7.5 is considerably harder, and I would say at least a year.</p>

<p>Most students are able to improve their reading and listening skills themselves, provided they know how to proceed. However, the writing and speaking tests require a significant amount of teacher preparation for a good score, so most of my lessons are focused on these two areas. For success in the speaking test, what you say is not as important as how you say it, and if you learn with me, I will train you to speak natural English and at a high level. Success in IELTS writing similarly depends not so much about what you write as how you write. I will teach you how to write in the necessary style combined with the correct structure for a high band score.</p>

<p>Well, it has been a pleasure, but unfortunately I have to go now, as I am meeting one of my sons down the pub for a beer in half an hour, so bye for now.</p>

<p>That last sentence, written in a natural and informal style, made you feel like I was actually there with you when I wrote it, it is the style you need to use for informal letters in the IELTS general test - but I have a surprise for you - I am already down the pub!"</p>
