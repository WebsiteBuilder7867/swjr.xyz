	  <h1>Prepositions</h1>
	  <p>Prepositions are particularly difficult to teach because although there are some general rules, the use of certain prepositions in certain circumstances makes little sense. The best way to learn which ones to use, is to read as much as possible, making a conscious note of the use of each preposition when you come across it. Before long, you will know instinctively which one to use.</p>
