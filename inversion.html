      <p>This piece of grammar adds emphasis to the word "Never." It is a little formal, but good for both writing and speaking tests. If you use this piece of grammar correctly, your examiner will be very impressed indeed.</p>
      <p>Instead of "I have never heard" you can say or write "Never have I heard."</p>   
      <p>"Never, in the field of human conflict, has so many owed so much to so few." A famous quote by Winston Churchill (talking about the sacrifice of pilots of all nations who saved our country from invasion during the Battle of Britain 10 Jul40 to 31 Oct 40).</p> 	
      <p>"Rarely have I heard such good English spoken by a Russian student, he obviously has lessons on Italki."</p>
