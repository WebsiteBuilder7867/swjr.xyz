	    <h1>Words for Cohesion</h1>
	    <p>The ability to join sentences and paragraphs together to form a natural English "flow" is essential to obtain a good score in both the Coherence and Cohesion criterion in the writing test and the Fluency and Coherence criterion in the speaking test, both of which count for 25% of your marks. The link below has both all the necessary words and phrases you need, as well as a flashcard system to help you learn them.  Remember to learn, not only what the phrases mean, but in what context they should be used, for example: agreement, disagreement, cause etc.</p>
