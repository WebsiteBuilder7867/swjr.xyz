	    <h1>Present Perfect Continuous Tense</h1>

      <h2>Present Perfect Time Period</h2>
      <p><u>The present perfect time period is a period of time which started in the past and leads up to and includes the present. It is a time period which started in the past but has not yet expired. For example: since yesterday, since Roman times, for the last two years, ever, never.</u></p>
    

      <h2>Present Perfect Continuous Tense</h2>

      <p><u>Is used to focus on an action, or on the duration of an action, which has been ongoing during the above time period. The action may end just before or during the time of speaking, or may continue for an indefinite period beyond the time of speaking. The time the action has been taking place does not have to be stated, but if it is, it is always in present time.</u><br>
      eg. I have been studying English. (Focus on action)<br>
      eg. I have been studying English today. (Time stated, today has not yet passed)<br>
      eg. I have been studying English since I was 10 years old. (Focus on duration)</p>
           
      <p>Note: The present perfect and present perfect continuous can sometimes be used interchangeably, especially with feelings vocabulary eg. I have felt ill all day or I have been feeling ill all day.</p>

      <p>Remember that some verbs do not have a continuous tense and some have a different meaning in the continuous tense, so be careful!</p>

      <p>The following words and phrases sometimes indicate the use of the present perfect continuous</p>
