      <h2>The Past Simple Time Period</h2>
      <p><u>The past simple time period is the time period which has passed and which we do not live in.</u></p>
      <h2>The Past Continuous Tense</h2>
      <p><u>Describes an action which was ongoing during the past simple time period. It is used to express that an action was ongoing at a point of time in the past, or that two actions were ongoing at the same time.</u><br>
      eg. I was eating my sandwiches at 13.00 yesterday (point of time = yesterday).<br>
      eg. I was watching television when the doorbell rang (point of time = when the doorbell rang).<br>
      eg. I was eating my sandwiches and drinking my tea when the doorbell rang (two ongoing actions at a point of time in the past).</p>

      <p>Note: sometimes two or more ongoing actions are used together to describe a scene, but without stating the time the action took place. This is rare and usually at the beginning of written stories - will not use for ielts speaking or writing, but be aware of it as you may hear it in the listening test, or read it in the writing test. For example: Fred and Bill were watching TV, their mother was cooking lunch and the cat was drinking milk.</p>
      
      <p>This is a general summary for revision only. For a more detailed and thorough explanation, see English Grammar in Use by Raymond Murphy or Grammarway 3 by Jenny Dooley and Virginia Evans.  The first is a reference book and the second is a course book. Both are highly recommended and contain the necessary grammar exercises with answers.</p>
