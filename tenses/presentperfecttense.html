      <p><u>The present perfect time period is a period of time which started in the past and leads up to and includes the present. It is a time period which started in the past but has not yet expired. For example: since yesterday, since Roman times, for the last two years, ever, never. In reality, the present perfect time period is really just a part of the present time; its totality represented by the blue area in the diagrams.</u><br><br></p>

      <p><u>Describes an action which has been completed during either the present perfect or present perfect time periods.  When we use the present perfect, we do not need to mention the time the action has taken place, especially if the action has taken place only a short time before speaking. When we state the time, it is always in the present.</u><br>
      eg. I have finished eating my dinner. (The time is not stated, this indicates that the action has been completed a very short time ago, and can therefore be considered to be in the present time period).
      eg. I have brushed my teeth this morning. (Said during the morning - it is still morning, we are living in this time period: it is present time.)<br>
      Note: I brushed my teeth this morning. (Said during the afternoon - the morning has passed, hence past simple).<br>
      eg. Have you ever been to France? = Have you been to France during your life? (You are still alive, so this is present time: actions of a dead person are always in the past!)<br>
      eg. What have you done since we last met? This sentence focuses on the completion of the action: we would use the present perfect continuous if we wanted to focus on the action itself.<br></p>
      
      <p>Note: The present perfect and present perfect continuous can sometimes be used interchangeably, especially with feelings vocabulary eg. I have felt ill all day = I have been feeling ill all day.</p>

      <p>Remember that some verbs do not have a continuous tense and some have a different meaning in the continuous tense, so be careful!</p>

    
      <p>The following words and phrases sometimes indicate the use of the present perfect.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Today</li>
            <li>This week</li>
            <li>This century</li>
            <li>This year</li>            
            <li>Until now</li>
            <li>Recently</li>
            <li>Yet</li>
            <li>Since</li>
