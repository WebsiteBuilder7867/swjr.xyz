      <p><br>Dear English Learner,</p>

      <p>Thank you for your interest in my site: I am a British English language tutor and have been tutoring English online for four years. I have lived most of my life in the United Kingdom and a few years in the United States. Both my parents were British and I was educated in the UK. In 2015 I attended the <a href="https://lalschools.com/adults/destination/torbay/">LAL English Language School in Paignton, South Devon, England</a> where I learned how to teach English to adults and received my <a href="celtacertificateimage.html">CELTA (Certificate of English Language Teaching to Adults)</a> issued by Cambridge English, a part of the University of Cambridge. Cambridge English is responsible for setting the IELTS exam in the UK. I have also been studying Russian for the last few years and can now speak at intermediate level. This not only helps in communication, but also helps me to understand the problems Russian students have to overcome, particularly with tenses, articles and prepositions.</p>

      <p>I have tutored many students over the last few years; some have emigrated to Canada, Ireland and Australia. Some of my students have gone on to study in foreign universities, particularly the United Kingdom. I have also tutored airline pilots and air stewardesses who need English to fly internationally or enter the airline pilot school in the UK. Although the main focus of my work is the IELTS exam (I do not tutor for any other exams), I will be pleased to help you with any aspect of English, including translations, resumes (CVs) and job interview preparation as it can be a pleasant break from my daily routine.</p>

      <p>I work via an online platform called "italki" which provides a scheduling calendar, payment and messaging system. Trial lessons are only a half hour long, after that, each lesson is one hour. The structure of the lesson will depend on the student's needs but are nearly always focused on speaking or writing, or both. I tutor students up to Band 7.5, which is C1, advanced level.</p>

      <p>If you would like to know more, please click on the button below which will take you to my italki profile page. Here, you can watch a video presentation, read student reviews, see up-to-date lesson pricing and view my availability. If you wish to contact me, you will need to register for free with italki and message me via their messaging system. I look forward to meeting you soon and teaching you to speak fluent, natural English.</p>

      <p>Yours sincerely</p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Richards</i><br></p>
