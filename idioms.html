        <h1>Idioms</h1>

    <div class="row">
    <div class=".visible-xs-block, hidden-xs">  						
		<p>The correct use of an idiom will be looked upon very favorably by your examiner, as it is a sign of an advanced speaker. It is unlikely that you will receive a band score of 7 and above without using idioms and phrasal verbs appropriately. Always use an idiom in an informal letter and in your spoken test. Do not use them in formal essays and graph descriptions up to band 7.5. At a very advanced level, IELTS band 8 and 9, I would advise their use in formal essays, but not all idioms are suitable. Choosing the correct ones and in the correct context is a native speaker level skill. Do not overuse them, two throughout the whole speaking test and one in an informal letter is enough. Using more than this may sound unnatural and forced.</p>
						
		<p>Native British speakers use a lot of idiomatic speech. I have chosen the following selection because they are in contemporary use and are easy to insert into speaking and/or writing tests. For most tests, use just one or two, any more may be seen as excessive and unnatural.</p>

		<p>Remember that you may hear an idiom in the listening test, so its important to understand what they all mean!</p>

 	<!--	The three little pigs
The three little pigs are brothers. They are LIKE CHALK AND CHEESE. They HAVE ITCHY FEET and they are going into the forest. They want to build three houses. "Let’s build our houses here," says the first little pig, Percy. "Yes," says the second little pig, Peter. "That’s a good idea," says the third little pig, Patrick. The first little pig, Percy, thinks “The house will COST ME AN ARM AND A LEG, besides building houses, it IS NOT MY CUP OF TEA”. He gets some straw and builds a house of straw IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. The second little pig, Peter, decides to PADDLE HIS OWN CANOE. He gets some wood and starts to build a house of wood. The third pig, Patrick, is very clever. He is A BRIGHT SPARK and KEPT HIS BROTHERS IN THE DARK. He wants to build a very solid house, so he gets some bricks and starts to build a house of bricks. Now all the houses are ready. The three little pigs are ON CLOUD NINE and JUMPS FOR JOY.
But a big bad wolf lives in the forest. He is old but FIT AS A FIDDLE  and he knows the forest very well. THE FOREST IS HIS NECK OF THE WOODS. Every day the wolf watches the pigs. He is hungry and he wants to eat them. He goes to the house of straw and knocks on the door. "Can I come in, little pig? I’m not very big!" he says. But Percy sees it is a big bad wolf. He says, "SLING YOUR HOOK, You can’t come in." But the wolf blows and blows and the house falls down. "Help!" shouts Percy. He runs to his brother Peter’s house. Now the wolf is very hungry. He wants his dinner and  runs to the house of wood and knocks on the door. "Can I come in, little pigs? I’m not very big!" he says. But Percy and Peter say, "GET LOST! You can’t come in." But the wolf blows and blows and the house falls down. "Help!" shout Percy and Peter. They GO OFF THE DEEP END and run to their brother Patrick’s house. Patrick says to his brothers: “ IT IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. DON’T CRY OVER SPILLED MILK”.
Now the wolf runs to the house of bricks. The three little pigs are in the house. He knocks on the door. "Can I come in, little pigs? I’m not very big!" he says. Percy, Peter and Patrick say, "Go away! You can’t come in. " The wolf blows and blows, and he blows and blows again, but the house doesn’t fall down. It’s a house of bricks and it’s very strong. The wolf sits down and thinks. "I can wait," he says, “I AM ALWAYS ON THE BALL AND WILL KEEP AN EYE ON YOU, COME RAIN OR SHINE” The three little pigs, Percy, Peter and Patrick are in the house and shout to the wolf: “WE WILL FIGHT TO THE BITTER END, YOU CANNOT GET US. PIGS WILL FLY.”. They are hungry. "The wolf is waiting. We can’t go out. We can’t get dinner," says Percy. "What can we do?" asks Peter. "Don’t be sad. It’s OK," says the clever pig, Patrick. "We have A HARD NUT TO CRACK and I’ve got an idea."
New happy end:
At this time the wolf FEELS UNDER THE WEATHER while waiting near the house.
Patrick goes to the door and says to the wolf: ”YOU DON’T NEED TO EAT ONLY MEAT. THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER. Today you have A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO START A NEW LIFE. Become a vegetarian!”
The wolf says: “YOU ARE SPOT-ON.  I WILL TAKE A LEAF OUT OF YOUR BOOK”. He decides to THROW IN THE TOWEL and begins to eat fruits and vegetables and FEELS AS RIGHT AS RAIN.
Three little pigs and the wolf live as friends happily ever after. The end.  Thanks to Olesya for permission to publish.-->
