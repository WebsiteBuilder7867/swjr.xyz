  	  <h1 style="text-align:center;">How to Memorise Vocabulary</h1>
	  <p>Having a good stock of words is absolutely essential to understand and speak any language.  
	  Even without any knowledge of grammar, someone with a good knowledge of words can understand the general gist 
	  of a conversation or article in a newspaper. One of the most difficult problems students have is remembering such a large number of words. Here I will give you some tips on how to proceed.</p>
      <h2 style="text-align:center;">Short-term and long-term memory</h2>		
	  <p>For the purpose of learning vocabulary, we can consider the brain as having two types of memory, 
	  short-term and long-term. Short-term memory holds information for less than a minute and long-term memory for up to a lifetime.  
	  Short-term memory is sometimes called "working-memory."</p>
      <p>A different part of the brain filters out insignificant information and background noise 
	  then transfers the important bits to the long-term memory.</p>
	  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Inserting the word into short-term memory</h2>		
	  <p>The short-term memory can remember letter sequences without the use of memory techniques of between five and nine for very short periods of time. However, by splitting those sequences into smaller groups, the number of letters remembered can be increased. Take, for example, the word "forgetfulness." Rather than trying to remember all the letters in one sequence, you will help your short-term memory if you split them into shorter groups like this “for-get-ful-ness.” Each of these groups has a meaning of its own, which makes them easy to remember. "For" is a word, "get" is a word, "ful(l)" is a word, and "ness" is a common suffix, or similar to the name of a Scottish monster called "Nessy." In essence, it is now only necessary to remember four small groups of letters, which is quite easy for the short-term memory.</p>
	  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Inserting the word into long-term memory</h2>		
	  <p>The mind uses a number of criteria to determine whether or not information is important enough to be transferred to long-term memory</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:left;">1. Spaced Repetition</h3>					
	  <p>The more often that a word is "fired," in the brain, by being heard, read, or spoken, the more important the brain considers it to be. Spaced repetition uses the system of reading the word on the first day, then the following day, then a couple of days later, then three days later etc.  This system is used by many popular vocabulary learning systems, including Anki and Memrise.	<a href="https://www.memrise.com">Memrise</a> is an excellent spaced repetition program that I use and recommend to learn vocabulary, it is most effective when installed on a computer with a keyboard, however, it can also be used on an i-pad, i-pod or i-phone. Unfortunately, Memrise is a paid program, but there is a free trial period.  Another popular program is <a href="http://lingualeo.com/chooselanguage?returnUrl=">Lingualeo</a>, which is suitable for students whose native language is Russian, Portuguese, Turkish or Spanish. <a href="https://www.ankiapp.com/">Anki</a> is a free and popular electronic spaced repetition flashcard program which is suitable for i-phones and tablets. Another good free flashcard program is available on <a href="https://www.lingvolive.com/en-us">ABBYY Lingvo Live.</a> However, this is not spaced repetition. It is very easy to make your own cards on ABBYY Lingvo.  ABBYY also sell dictionary downloads. I have an online version which searches 60 Russian - English dictionaries at the same time. It provides grammar advice on the use of the words and examples of them in use.There is also a flashcard program available when you purchase a dictionary. See ABBYY for up-to-date information.</a></p>
      <p>If you prefer physical cards, with English words on one side, and your native language on the other, you can purchase them online. 
	  Alternatively, you can make them yourself by writing the English word on one side, and its translation on the other side, but upside-down. 
	  This will make it easy to flip them over quickly.</p>				
	  <h3 style="text-align:left;">2. Experiencing the Word in Different Ways</h3>				
	  <p>The more different ways a word is used, the more important the mind considers it to be. This is why we need to repeat and experience it in as many different ways as possible. We say it out loud, we read it, we write it, we record it and play it back, we type it into our computer, we use the word in sentences and think about it. We should do this as often as possible, and over a period of days or even weeks. It is better to review a word quickly and frequently than to dwell on a word and try to remember it.</p>
	  <h3 style="text-align:left;">3. Emotional Attachment</h3>
	  <p>The more emotion that can be attached to a word, the more important the mind considers it to be. When we were children, we experienced the world in a different way. We were inquisitive, and everything new that we discovered invoked a feeling. For example, let's take the word "teddy." When a mother gives a teddy-bear to her child, the child hugs it, feels its texture, talks to it and names it "Teddy." Teddy is a source of pleasure and comfort for him. The word "teddy" becomes a verbal reference to this item and its associated pleasure. It is this emotional attachment that makes it easy for the child to remember it.  When I was a child we had a French student teacher who made the whole class fall onto the floor whenever he said the word "tombey," which is French for "fall." Although I was only 11 years old at the time, it is still one of the few French words I remember, and it stays in my mind because of all the fun we had.  Adults are not as emotionally reactive as children, and do not remember new vocabulary with such ease. However, it will still help if we can attach an emotion to the new word. For example, let's take the word "ice-cream." If we imagine eating an ice-cream, how it feels cold on a hot day, how tasty it is, how refreshing, then the word becomes easier to remember.</p>
	  <h3 style="text-align:left;">4. Context</h3>
	  <p>The mind considers a word important if the meaning of a sentence cannot be understood without it. When we read and listen to English regularly, the words become "contextualised" in memory. This not only makes them easier to remember, but makes it easier to quickly choose and retrieve the correct word during conversation. Some memory learning systems make use of this system, for example, <a href="http://www.mosalingua.com">Mosalingua</a>, which is suitable for Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and German speaking learners of English.</p>
	  <h3 style="text-align:left;">5. Connections</h3>
	  <p>The mind remembers information best when it can connect the new information with information that is already held in memory. The memory is like a computer memory, a huge number of files interconnected by different routes along a series of synapses. This is similar to what we call a "path" when talking about the location of computer files. It is therefore important to initially create a path to the new word (file).  We can do this by making a mental connection with something that is already in memory. It does not matter how ridiculous the connection is, in fact, some believe that a funny connection is best because it creates an emotional spark which burns a synaptic path into the brain. Let's take a look at the word "sobaka," which is Russian for dog.  If I think of a dog barking, a "so-bark-er", which sounds like "so-bark-a," I have a connection	that will help me remember the word. After hearing and using the word a few times, the original connection will disappear, and the brain will create more logical and appropriate connections on its own. If we think of the Russian word "most," which means "bridge," we could think of a bridge with a huge mast sticking out of it. It is a ridiculous connection, but this image will help us to keep the connection long enough for the mind to create more appropriate ones.</p>
      <p>It is also a good idea to learn words which are naturally associated, for example: a noun with its associated verb; butter(n), to butter(v), and maybe a phrasal verb: to butter someone up - to praise someone falsely with the intent of manipulating him.</p>
      <p>You can also learn words in the same category which have similar meanings, for example: happiness, pleasure, joy, exhilaration, ecstasy, all of which are pleasant feelings.</p>
      <p>Don't learn opposites together because the mind sometimes gets them confused.</p>
	  <h3 style="text-align:left;">6. Reading</h3>
	  <p>Reading is a good way to increase your vocabulary.  There are many books called "graded readers," with vocabulary and translations in the margins or on separate pages. These are very good for learning vocabulary in context and improving your grammar at the same time.  If you have a Kindle Paperwhite reader, you can look up the translation of paragraphs, sentences or individual words by touching the screen. Unfortunatey, this feature is not available in all languages. To see how this works, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200954440">click here</a>.</p>
	  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Visual, Auditory, or Kinaesthetic?</h2>
	  <p>There are three types of learners, those who learn by what they see, by what they hear, and what they do. Although everyone is a mixture of all three, some people have a strong inclination towards one or two of the methods. It is obviously better to focus your learning efforts using the method that best suits you. For example, if you are a visual learner, you should focus on flashcards and may find the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=0-8384-2656-5">Heinle American English Visual Dictionary</a> useful. An auditory learner should spend more time listening to recordings of words.  A kinaesthetic learner will learn quicker by writing them down on paper or typing them on a keyboard. To find out which type you are, you can do a free test on this site <a href="http://www2.amk.fi/mater/kauppa_ja_talous/demand_forecasting/vak.php">VAK Test.</a></p>
	  <h2 style="text-align:left;">How many words should I learn?</h2>						
	  <p>The answer is - as many as possible. For a very basic vocabulary, you will need between 2500 and 3500 words. 
	  You can just about manage in England with this, but it will not be easy. If you have a vocabulary of 6000 to 7000 words, you will be able to manage in daily life without much help. However, to obtain a university degree, you will need anything between 9000 and 12000 words, depending on your major.  How many words shall I learn each day? The answer is - as many as possible. A university student studying a foreign language on a three-year university course will need to learn about 10 words a day. 10 X 365 (No days off!) = 3650 a year. For 3 years, 3 X 3650 = 10950, which is about what he needs.</p>
	  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Which words should I learn first?</h2>
	  <p>Most computer learning programs present words in sets, starting with the most frequently used words, and ending with the least frequently used. This is the way you should do it. It is possible to obtain bilingual frequency dictionaries for learners which list words in order of frequency of use. However, you may have to search the internet quite a while in order to find a good one with translations into your native language.</p>
      <p>If you are studying a specialised subject, then there are word lists and computer downloads available that provide words for just about every field of study or work. Once again, you may have to search the internet quite a while before you find something suitable.</p>
