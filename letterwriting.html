		<h1>General Advice on How to Write Letters: Formal and Informal</h1>
        <p>Try to include (as far as is reasonably possible without sounding unnatural), a less frequently used tense, at least one less-frequently used word, a conditional, a phrasal verb, and idiom (for informal letters only).  Use a range of discourse markers, although, moreover, however, etc. - Show the examiner what you know!</p>
        <p>Plan your letter like this -</p>
        <p>Salutation (Dear…..)<br>
        Introduction Paragraph – Why you are writing the letter.<br>
        1st Information Paragraph<br>
        2nd Information Paragraph<br>
        3rd Information Paragraph<br>
        Closing Paragraph<br>
        Complimentary close (Yours sincerely etc)<br>
        Signature</p>
        <p>There is some controversy as to whether or not a comma should be put after the salutation and compliment. When I was in school and later did a word processing course, it was compulsory, but it is left out on a lot of letters I receive now. Unfortunately the ielts organisation gives no guidance that I know of. I have left them out in the examples.</p>
        <p>Time schedule: 2.5 minutes to plan, 3 minutes each for the introduction,  3 minutes for each of three information paragraphs and 3 minutes for the closing paragraph.  2.5 minutes to check for errors.</p>
        <p>Note: you may have just two information paragraphs, in which case adjust accordingly.</p>
        <p> When you have finished your letter - </p>
          
          <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>Check that you have used the correct tense(s).</li>
                <li>Check that you have used "a," "an," and "the" everywhere that they are required.</li> 
                <li>Check that your sentence structure is correct - subject, verb, object etc. </li>
                <li>Check that you have not used abbreviations except obvious ones such as m or km.</li>
                <li>Check that you have not used contractions in formal letters. You can and should use them in informal ones.</li>
                <li>Check that you have used adjectives to describe nouns and adverbs to describe actions, not the other way around.</li>
                <li>Check that you have used singular and plural appropriately and added "s" to third person singular.</li>
                <li>Chat that the first letter is a capital for proper nouns.
                <li>Check your punctuation.</li>    
                <li>Check that you have answered the question that was asked and not a similar question. (For information about this, read the essay writing section.</li>
                <li>Check that you have written at least 150 words, but limit it to 165 because you have little time and should not waste it by writing excessively. If you write a lot more or one word less than 150 words, you may lose marks for task completion, since you are specifically asked for 150, so the closer, the better.</li>
            </ul>

		<h1>Informal Letters</h1>
        <p>Informal letters should be written in natural, informal English and not appear to have been written in a hurry. You should show your personality in the letter; it should be friendly and informal. Try and open and end with something positive, put bad news etc., in the middle and something positive at the end.</p> 
        <p>Whenever possible, include information that is of interest to the recipient.</p>
        <h2>Salutation</h2>
        <p>For personal, informal letters to friends and relatives, start with "Dear, First name."<br>
        "Dear Mum," "Dear Dad." "Dear Aunt Betty," but for brother and sister, use first names.<br>
        For informal letters to organisations and people in their official capacity, "Dear Secretary,"" "Dear Chairman,"" "Dear Chief of Police,"
        "Dear Prime Minister,"" "Dear Electricity Supply Company PLC."</p>
        <h2>Complimentary Close</h2>
        <p>“Your son” - son to father.<br>"Your loving son" - son to mother.<br>"Love"- daughter to father or mother.<br>“Dad,” “Mum” - parent to son or daughter.</p>               
        <p>"With deepest sympathy" - for letters of condolence.<br>“Merry Christmas,” or “Happy Easter,” can be used in all informal letters.</p>			
        <p>However, for informal letters to organisations and people in their official capacity, follow the same rules as with formal letters for the salutation and compliment.</p>
        <p>These letters are generally written in the active voice, although passive can be used when the active is unsuitable.</p>
        <h2>Example of informal letter</h2>
        <p>You have recently met an old friend in London, write an informal letter to invite him to a family event. 150 Words in 20 minutes<br><br></p>
	 
	  	  <div class="sheeta">
            <p><br>Hello Jack</p>
            <p>It was a pleasure to meet you in Trafalgar Square on Saturday.  You know, I can’t get over how quick time flies. Why, it seems like only yesterday that we were in school together playing football and causing trouble in the neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>We had such fun, do you remember the time we kicked the ball into PC Rodney’s police car and smashed the windscreen and my father blew his top? Those were the days - not a worry in the world!</p>
            <p>Times have changed, now we are married with families of our own a careers which take up so much of our time.</p>
            <p>My wife and I are celebrating our fifteenth wedding on 25th January, and would like to invite you and your wife to a celebratory dinner in Ceasar’s Italian Restaurant in Torquay, down by the harbour. It’s a new place with lots of good reviews.  After that, we could have a couple of drinks on the yacht and reminisce about the old times.</p>
            <p>All the Best</p>
            <p>Steve</p>

		<h1>Formal Letters</h1>
		<p>Do not express negative emotions such as anger, or disgust with the recipient.</p>
        <p>Try and keep the letter as simple as possible, focusing on facts.</p>
        <p>Where an apology is appropriate, make the apology clear without denigrating yourself in any way.</p>
        <p>Try not to be too short, but do not give too much unnecessary information.</p>
        <p>Be sure to show, where necessary, that you have taken the views and considerations of the receiver of the letter into consideration.</p>
        <p>It is a good idea to put at least some passive voice into the letter to make it sound a bit more formal, but it should not be all passive, see the example below</p>
        <h2>Salutation</h2>
        <p>"Dear Sir," "Dear Madam," "Dear Mr Jones," " "Dear Mrs Jones," "Dear Miss Jones," "Dear Ms Jones," "Dear Manager," "Dear Secretary,"" "Dear Chairman," "Dear Chief of Police," "Dear Prime Minister,"" “Dear Electricity Supply Company PLC."</p>
        <h2>Complimentary Close</h2>
        <p>End the letter with "Yours sincerely" if you know the addressee and have named him in the salutation, for example: Dear Mr Jones.<br> End the letter with "Yours faithfully" if you have stated Dear XYZ Company or Dear Customer Services etc., in the salutation.</p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>You have purchased a washing machine from a shop. However, it has broken down three times since you purchased it. Write a letter to the shop owner. State:<br>
					
		  <div class="list">       
			<ul>
			  <li>What went wrong.</li>
              <li>Why you think it is unsuitable.</li>
              <li>What he can do to improve the situation.</li>
            </ul>
          </div><!--list-->  
                
        <p>150 Words in 20 minutes.<br><br></p>   
                                         
          <div class="sheeta">		 
            <p><br>Dear Electorshop</p>
            <p>I purchased a new washing machine off you on 2nd August 2017 and am very disappointed with it as it has broken down twice with a month of delivery.</p>
            <p>The first time an engineer was called out, he had to replace the door and hinges.</p>
            <p>The second time it broke down, the belt had to be replaced.</p>
            <p>Apparently, there has been a lot of problems with this model of machine, in fact, the engineer stated that he would never buy one because they are not made to last.
            Furthermore, according to the "Which" magazine, it is a very poorly built machine and unsuitable for long-term use.</p>
            <p>I would be grateful if my machine could be replaced with a similar one but of a different make, gratis.</p>
            <p>Yours faithfully</p>
            <p>Steven</p>
