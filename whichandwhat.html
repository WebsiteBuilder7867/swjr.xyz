	<h2>Which</h2>
	<p>"Which" is used for choices which are countable.<p>
    </p> For example:</p> 
    <p>"Which doughnut would you like?" - While offering someone a choice of doughnuts.</p>
    <p>"That is the one which I want." - While pointing to the doughnut.</p>
    <p>When answering as above, we usually do not include "which," as it is already understood: "That is the doughnut (which) I want."</p>
    <p>When asking about men who are unknown to you: Question: "Which man did it?" "Answer: "This (or that) man is the man that did it."</p> 
    <p>However, if you and the person you are speaking to know the men (even generally or vaguely). Question: "Who is the man who did it?" Answer: "He is the man who did it."</p>
    <h2>What</h2>
    <p>"What" is used for choices which are uncountable.<p>
    </p>For example:</p> 
    <p>"What is the capital of Spain?" "What is the best way to do it?"</p>
    <p>Never use "what" in the answer.</p>
    <p>"Madrid is the capital of Spain." "This is the best way to do it."</p>
