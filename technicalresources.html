      <h1>Technical Resources for Online Lessons</h1>
	    <p>Most of my lessons take place on Skype, you can download it <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/">here.</a></p>
      <p> Skype requires at least 1.5Mbps upload and download speeds for a good Skype connection. Please check these speeds <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">here</a> before your lesson starts. For increased speeds, close all other tabs and switch off any other devices connected to your internet service.</p>
      <p> Zoom is similar to Skype, but uses less bandwidth, please download this onto your computer for emergency use. Click <a href="https://zoom.us/">here.</a></p>
      <p>Tablets and mobile phones are generally unsuitable for lessons, except for conversation practice.</p>
      <p>A good set of noise-cancelling voip headphones are essential. I recommend Sennheiser. Noise cancelling headphones have a small hole on the opposite side of the microphone input to cut out external noises, including computer noise and feedback.</p>  
      <p><a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/">Google Docs</a> - Please use Google Docs for sending me letters and essays for editing or correcting. Please copy the link and send it to me over Skype during the lesson, please remember to allow me to edit. You need a Google e-mail account to use Google Docs. Full instructions on how to create a link with editing permission can be found <a href="usegoogledocs.html">here</a></p>
      <h2>Students in China</h2>
      <p> Students in China are advised to use a Chinese VPN server whenever possible and legal. 
      For faster internet, please ensure your VPN server is as close to your computer as possible and within 
      The People's Republic of China. Paid VPN services are usually better than free ones.</p>
      <h2>Students in Dubai</h2>
      <p>As an italki teacher, I am not allowed to recommend VPNs, however, I have had a good connection with a student in Dubai who was using <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">Nord VPN.</a></p>
