	  <p>During your test, you will have little time to count the number of words, so practice writing your letters on the official answer sheet and note how many lines you use for 150 words. 
    You can download it here: <a href="ieltswritinganswersheet.pdf">Answer Sheet.</a> Remember that hyphenated words count as one word. You must write at least 150 words, but not over 165, complete in 20 minutes or less.</p>
	  <p>Please type your letters into Google Docs after you complete them, then send me the link for marking during the lesson.  Remember to allow me permission to edit.</p>
	  <p>If you don't know how to do this, click here for instructions. <a href="usegoogledocs.html">Google Docs.</a> You must have a Google account for this to work.</p>
    <p>Remember to include lots of grammar structures, phrasal verbs, modal verbs, idiomatic speech, tenses and less-frequently used words, but in a natural way, it must not sound "forced." Remember to use an idiom in informal letters.</p>
