          <p><br><b>The internet has brought huge changes, some for the better, others for the worse.</b></p>
          <p><b>Discuss some of them and state whether, in your opinion, the positive aspects exceed the negative.</b></p>
	      <p>The internet has revolutionised the way we communicate, obtain services and search for entertainment. However, I believe  there is a negative side of internet use which exceeds the positive. In this essay, I will present and explain my reasons.</p>	
		  <p>Firstly, a deficit of face-to-face communication has arisen from its use. While in the past, people met in social clubs, religious institutions and sporting facilities, most people today are glued to their computer screens and mobile phones. This clearly shows that the internet has had a negative impact on social interraction. If we want to have all the psychological and emotional benefits associated with face-to-face communication, we must spend less time on the internet.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the main benefit of internet use is said to be the amount of time saved, particularly on shopping, by lightening-speed information transfer.  However, I believe that the lure of the internet actually encourages people to spend more time shopping than they would otherwise do because of all the distractions, such as pop-ups and messages. Furthermore, it deprives people of the valuable exercise they would have received had they had to wander around the malls and market stalls.  In this way, the internet can have a negative effect on our health.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, internet use has a serious effect on our social lives and our long-term health. These are two of the most important factors for bringing happiness to our lives. Therefore, this negative influence far exceeds any benefit we could possibly receive from surfing the net.</p>

	  <p>The essay is only in British English, essays can be written in American English, but should not be mixed.</p>
	  <p>The word count meets the limit, but does not exceed it. It is inevitable that you will go over a little, but do not exceed, say 265. (there is no exact figure that I am aware of).</p>
