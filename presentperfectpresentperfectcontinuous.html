    <p>Lets first revise the meaning of the word “present” in a grammatical sense.</p>
    <p>The PRESENT TIME PERIOD, in a grammatical sense, is the moment of speaking and the period of time around the moment of speaking: it is the time period in which we now live, it has not expired. For example, today, this month, this year etc.<br>
    The PRESENT PERFECT TIME PERIOD refers to time periods which lead up to, just before, or just into the present. For example: ever, never, until now, for the last three years, since I was a child.<br>
    NOTE: do not confuse time periods with tenses. Time periods are associated with time, tenses are associated with verbs - a clear understanding of the difference is essential to understanding how to use English verbs correctly.</p>
    <h2>Present Perfect Tense</h2>
    <p>I have sang the song. - focuses on the completion of an action during the present perfect time period.
    I have washed the car. - emphasis on the completion (and hence also the obvious but unspoken result - the car is clean).</p>
    <p>The present perfect tense therefore expresses that an action has been completed during the present perfect time period and if there is a result, usually states or implies it.</p> 
    <h2>Present Perfect Continuous</h2>
    <p>“Continuous,” in a grammatical sense, means “incomplete, ongoing.” The present perfect continuous tense is therefore used for a verb whose action continues through the present perfect time period.
    <p>This tense is particularly useful when we want to emphasise the long duration of an action which has continued for a period of time up to or close to the moment of speaking. For example, “He is tired because he has been working all day.”</p>
    <p>Alternatively, if we don’t wish to state how long the action took place, we can just say “He has been working.” This is usually used when we can see evidence of the action.  In the last example, we can actually see that the man is tired.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>the present perfect and present perfect continuous tense can often be used with no difference in meaning, especially with state verbs.</p>
    <p>I have felt ill all day.<br>
    I have been feeling ill all day.</p>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>Question: When the present perfect continuous case is used, does it mean that the action is ongoing in the present, and does it continue into the future?</p>
    <p>Answer: It may have only just stopped in the present time. Look at the above example: the man is tired because he has been working up until just now - the context in which the verb is used will usually help us here. The use of the present perfect continuous tells us nothing about the future.</p>
    <p>Question: Some text books say that the present perfect is used for actions which are of short duration and the present perfect continuous for longer actions, is this true?</p>
    <p>Answer: It is a generalisation. The important thing to consider is what the speaker wishes to emphasise, if he wants to emphasise the long duration of the action, he will use the present perfect continuous - "I have been waiting a whole hour (angry)." If he wants to emphasise a short period, then the present perfect - "I have only waited an hour."</p>
    <p>Question: Can I use the present perfect continuous with all verbs?</p>
    <p>Answer: No, some verbs do not make sense in the present perfect continuous, especially state verbs. For example, we cannot say "I have been marrying for five years." However, we can say "I have been married for five years. Some verbs also have a different meaning in the continuous form. For example: "I have seen" and "I have been seeing" have two entirely different meanings!"</p> 
    <p>Sometimes it is easy to decide which to use, sometimes you can use either, other times you can use the wrong one and nobody will notice!  Getting it right all the time is a native speaker skill and is achieved by getting a feel for the language.  It is the reason I encourage my students to read and listen to as much English as possible.</p>
