	<h1>Practice Essays</h1>
	<p>The following practice essays should be between 250 and 265 words and take no more than 40 minutes.  First write your essay on the official answer sheet which you can download <a href="ieltswritinganswersheet.pdf">here</a>, then type it into Google Docs after you complete it, and send me the link for marking during the lesson.  Remember to allow me permission to edit. If you don't know how to do this, click <a href="usegoogledocs.html">here</a> for instructions.  Note: you must have a Google account for this to work.</p> 

	<p>First read the question carefully so that you can give an answer to exactly what the question asks and nothing else. Remember to use a paragraph for the introduction, another for the main body and another for the conclusion. Use different tenses, modal verbs, phrasal verbs and conditionals as well as grammar structures such as "used to," "am used to," and "getting used to." You should also use some advanced vocabulary. Check your articles, tenses, punctuation and number of words when you finish.</p> 

    <p>The reason for using the answer paper is to find out how many lines of your handwriting constitutes 250 words. This will save you time counting words during the exam.</p>
