	<h2>An Excerpt from: Stories of Authors by Edward Watts Chub</h2>		
	<p>The close of the sixteenth century is one of the most remarkable
    periods in the history of the world. Indeed, so striking is the
    intellectual activity of this age that lately an eminent scientist
    advanced the hypothesis that some electric influence, some magnetic
    current must have let itself loose to work upon the destinies of the
    world in the production of great men. For in that period in Italy we
    find Tasso, the greatest of modern epic poets; then too lived Galileo
    and Kepler, the astronomers; in France we find the philosophic
    essayist, Montaigne; in Spain the world-renowned Cervantes, the author
    of the immortal Don Quixote; in England both Bacon and Shakespeare,
    beside a host of other writers, generals, admirals and artists. This
    same age is the most flourishing period in India; so, too,
    in China, in Japan, and even in far away Persia we find an unusual
    degree of intellectual activity.</p>

    <p>The England of Shakespeare! The phrase suggests a train of associations
    that kindle the imagination. The age of literature, war, conquest,
    adventure, discovery and achievement. The age of Sir Walter Raleigh, author,
    knight, and explorer; of Bacon, "the wisest, meanest and brightest of mankind."
    It is the age when Frobisher became the hero of the Northwest passage; the age of
    marvelous tales told by intrepid explorers and adventurers returning
    from America, a land whose fountains renewed youth and whose rivers
    flowed over sands of gold. It is the era of English sea-dogs pillaging
    Spanish provinces in spite of imperial manifestos, - above all, it is
    the age of the Spanish Armada.</p>

    <p>To recall what this means, it is necessary to remember that Spain was
    the great dominating empire of the sixteenth century. However, one midsummer 
    morning all England awoke to the glorious news that the invincible Armada lay at the bottom of the sea.</p>

    <p>England had triumphed, and now for the first time national life
    dreamed of the possibility of leadership in the great game of
    world-politics. The atmosphere was electric with new life. In rural
    England along the lanes flanked with green hedges Englishmen walked with
    their chests swelling with new pride. In bustling London people
    strode the city's streets with hearts pulsating with new warmth, and
    everywhere the eyes of all Englishmen flashed with new fire.</p>

    <p>Could a soul so sensitive as Shakespeare's live in such an atmosphere
    and not be influenced by it? Listen to him as he pays his beautiful,
    patriotic tribute to England's national glory:</p>

    <p> “This other Eden, demi-paradise,<br>
    This fortress built by nature for herself,<br>
    This precious stone set in a silver sea,<br>
    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.”</p>

<!-- Good evening ladies and gentleman, the subject of my presentation today will be, “How to choose a pet.”  

The aim of the presentation is to provide you with the necessary information to help you make an informed, responsible and appropriate choice of pet.

My presentation today is divided into three parts. Firstly, we will consider what kind of pet we are looking for, then we will need to ascertain how much free time we have to devote to it. Finally we will be thinking about its feeding requirements. 

People vary in the type of pet they like, some people like furry, cuddly animals and others prefer reptiles such as snakes and chameleons.  There are even people who keep spiders. Most people however, prefer to keep a cat or a dog as both have been living with people for hundreds, if not thousands of years, and we have become accustomed to having them around us.

It is also essential, to work out how much free time we have to devote to our pet. An animal that needs a lot of attention, for example, a large dog, may be unsuitable for someone with a busy work schedule, but it is unlikely to be a problem for someone who has retired and has a lot of free time. A snake may be more suitable for someone who spends a lot of time at work because it needs very little attention and nobody will break into his house if they know there is a snake in it.

Animals vary significantly in their nutritional requirements, snakes, for example, just eat one or two mice a week, while a large dog can guzzle down two or three large cans of dog food every day. The choice of pet may depend, in part, on the availability of food and the cost of feeding it.

In my opinion, these are the three most important factors to consider when choosing a pet.

There are also many other factors to consider such as accommodation for the pet, compatibility with a pet you already own, suitability for children if you have any and the availability of a vet who can treat the animal, especially an exotic bird such as a rare parakeet. 

Thank you all for listening to my presentation, I hope it will help you to make a good decision in the event that you decide to acquire a new pet.
