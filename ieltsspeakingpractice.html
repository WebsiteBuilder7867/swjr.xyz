  		<p>When doing the speaking part of the test, it is very important to use the most advanced grammar that you can. 
  		Ensure that you use a variety of tenses including less frequently used ones such as past perfect continuous, a couple of 
  		idioms or some idiomatic speech, and 
  		some phrasal verbs. Use a variety of conditionals, do your best to get a mixed conditional in. 
  		Use a variety of conjunctions and discourse markers to improve coherence. Also use some
  		less frequently used vocabulary. If you are unsure of what to say, do not say "ummm" while you think, and remember that words are
  		clearly separated in British English, do not join them together as you do in Portuguese. Speak at the right speed, 
  		this is about the speed that is spoken by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv9ovSfW-A8">Her Majesty the Queen.</a> 
  		Use appropriate intonation for higher scores. Remember that you are not being examined on the content of what you say, although you must answer the question you are asked and follow
  		a logical, sensible course. So it is OK to make the answers up provided you do not contradict yourself or say anything silly. Speaking
  		in this way is difficult at first, but it is a bit like learning to ride a bicycle, once it "clicks," you will find
  		it very easy.</a></p>
  			   	
  		<p>Practice these tests on your own and then we will repeat them in class.</p>
