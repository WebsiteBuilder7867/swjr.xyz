      <h1>Tips on Visiting the UK</h1>

      <h2>Transport to and from the London Airports</h2>

      <p>The main London airports are Stansted, Luton, Gatwick and Heathrow.  The cheapest transport from the airports into London is by bus. There are several bus companies, but the largest company is <a href="https://www.nationalexpress.com/en">National Express.</a>  Most people book the tickets online. One of the big advantages of using this company is that if your plane arrives late and you miss the bus, they will let you get on the next one free of charge (this is unofficial, but I have done it) provided there is free space. Buses usually run every half hour. Heathrow airport is also connected via the underground, but it is a little more expensive than the bus.</p>

      <h2>Tube and Buses</h2>

      <p>The London underground and buses charge according to Zones and have a capped (maximum) fee per day for the zones. Zone 1+2 together are at one amount, but if you travel into Zone 3, the maximum fee will go up. Hence, do all your out of Zone 1+2 travelling on the same day and all your travelling in Zone 3 on another day: this will save you money. You can only pay for your journeys on both the bus and the underground in London by using a visa debit or credit card if it has contactless payment: they do not accept cash! You can also purchase a <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/visitor-oyster-card">Visitor Oyster Card</a> this is good if you don't have a credit card for each member of your group. You cannot use just one card for several people using contactless payment: everyone (except children under 11 years old) must have his own card. Children between 11 and 15 can get a Young Visitor Discount (currently 50%) on their travel for the first 14 days with an Oyster card. Ask a member of staff to add this discount. Children under 11 travel free, but must be with an adult. Oyster cards should be ordered online in advance of travel, and will be delivered to you by mail. Travelcards are also available, but I believe they are not as cheap to use as Oystercards.</p>

      <h2>London Attractions</h2>

      <p>If you want to go to see attractions such as Madam Toussauds, the London Dungeon, the London Aquarium, the London Eye etc, you can purchase them online. Not only are they usually cheaper purchased this way, but you will not have to wait so long in the queues because you will have a time slot for entry, usually half an hour. For Madam Toussauds, walk past all queues, hand them your ticket and walk in! Remember: the London Dungeon, London Aquarium, Riverboat Cruise and London Eye are very close to each other, so best booked on the same day. Madam Toussauds is on Baker St, some distance away. Watch the weather when booking the London Eye, if is raining, you won't see so well.</p>
    
      <p>Big Ben, Westminster, The Changing of the Guard at Buckinham Palace and Trafalgar Square, are best seen on the same morning. Go to Westminster Tube Station early in the morning, view Big Ben and Westminster Cathedral. After this, walk over to Buckingham Palace via Regents Park.  It will take you about 25 minutes. There is a large cafe about half way through the park where you can purchase a cup of tea and a doughnut. Time yourself to arrive about half an hour before the Changing of the Guard ceremony, which usually starts at 11.00. This is to make sure you get a good spot to view it from.  The dates and times of the ceremony can be found <a href="https://changing-guard.com/dates-buckingham-palace.html">here</a> The reason for arriving early is to make sure you can get a good view. This video will give you an example of what to expect, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIfpwVYmPMk">click here.</a> After watching the Changing of the Guard, walk back across Regents Park to Whitehall. Then up Whitehall to Trafalgar Square and stop on your way to have your picture taken with one of the horse guards who are guarding their barracks and stables. If you are feeling a little thirsty, there are one or two pubs on the right hand side of Whitehall as you walk up to Trafalgar Square. The <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/">National Gallery</a> is located next to Trafalgar Square, entry is free.  When you take the above tour, I strongly recommend you do not go on a Saturday or Sunday. Demonstrations and protests take place along Whitehall and there are also a lot of tourists on these days, especially in the summer, which makes it a bit crowded. If you take the above tour, and started at 08.00, you should be in Trafalgar Square around 12.30, maybe sooner if you are a fast walker. Using the Tube or Taxi will not make a great difference between these points. I suggest, that from here, you walk to Picadilly Circus and visit McDonalds, because it is the cheapest place to eat in London, and then catch the tube at Picadilly, (close to McDonalds) and take the Picadilly Line Northbound to Holborn to visit the British Museum. Entry is free and this will take you to the end of your afternoon. Go back to your hotel for a break and wait until it starts to get dark. Take the tube to Picadilly Circus again. This time you will see it all lit up, and walk from there to Leicester Square, and from there down to Covent Gardens for a relaxing meal and drink.</p>       

      <p>Visit the Natural History Museum, Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum on the same day, they are all very close to each other and entry is free for all of them.  You need either the South Kensington (closest) or Gloucester Road (slightly further away) tube station. Both are a five or ten minute walk from the museums. There are some nice pubs, cafes and restaurants in South Kensington, and a lot cheaper than in the main central tourist area of the city.<p>

      <p>If you would like to book a guided tour of London, you can do so at this website, sometimes they have free tours, but you are expected to give a tip. <a href="https://www.neweuropetours.eu/">New Euro Tours</a></p>

      <h2>Transport around the UK</h2> 

      <p>The two main bus companies are <a href="https://uk.megabus.com/">Megabus</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalexpress.com/en">National Express.</a> Megabuses are usually very large double decker (two floor) buses. Very comfortable and roomy. However, Megabus only travels between major cities. I am a regular user of Megabus and it is my favourite means of long distance travel. National Express travels to more destinations, but is, on average, more expensive. However, they have a good airport service.<br>
      For the best prices, you should book your bus journey well in advance. The price of a seat on the bus rises significantly the closer you get to the travel time, unless of course, they still have spare seats, in which case the price will go down. Don't book a National Express bus to a ferry port if you suspect that the ferry may be cancelled due to bad weather. This is especially the case for the ferry to Ireland.  National Express may cancel your booking and not run the bus! The main London bus terminal for both companies is Victoria Coach Station, you can catch a bus from here to almost anywhere in the UK! Unfortunately, it is a very crowded place, especially in the summer. If you need to eat a good meal cheaply, then there is an upstairs cafe at the top end of the departure section. It is not well sign posted, so you may need to ask a member of staff. I suggest that you use the rest room at Victoria Railway/Underground station before walking over to the coach station because the facilities are much better and free at the railway station. It is not expensive at the coach station - but why pay needlessly?</p> 


      <p>If you wish to travel to Ireland, you can purchase Rail and Sail tickets from most destinations in the UK for a very low price. However, you need a UK address to have them delivered to you. These tickets are for rail and ferry travel to and from your destination in both countries. For London to Dublin, <a href="https://uk.megabus.com/">click here</a> and then click on "VIA FISHGUARD (IMPROVED LINK FROM ROSSLARE)." Remember that the Republic of Ireland is a different country and you will need a Shengen visa if you are not an EU citizen. The ferry crossing can be quite rough during stormy weather, so if you suffer from sea sickness, take the plane!</p>

      <h2>Luggage Storage</h2>
      <p>If you wish to store your luggage while you travel around London, you can use BAGBNB. They have over 90 storage facilities situated all over London, including one in Victoria. I have only used them once for their storage facility in Vauxhall, but found them very easy to work with, very little paperwork or hassle. However, you must book your storage online.  Here is the link: <a href="https://bagbnb.com/luggage-storage/london">BagBnB.</a></p>
    
      <h2>Clothing</h2>

      <p>Britain rarely gets extremely cold, or extremely hot. So unless the weather is exceptional, a light jacket, teeshirt and jeans is enough. Rain is the main problem, so remember to take a good umbrella. Some of the cheap ones you see on sale to tourists will break in even a light wind. A decent umbrella will cost you about £25 from Marks & Spencer or Debenhams.</p>

      <p>Car hire: petrol is very expensive in the UK. Furthermore, most hire companies have a large excess. This means you could pay, in some cases, the first £1500 of damage, plus the first £1500 of towing costs, even if it is not your fault!! Plus, there are parking fees everywhere. I got a £60 parking fine for staying 3 hours at a motorway services!! I had a hire van and the hire company charged me an additional £35 for administration. Stansted airport charged me £45 for a few hours there, and that was a normal charge, not even a fine!</p>

      <h2>Accommodation</h2>

      <p>If you are a student and want a cheap, clean hostel, close to the centre of London, with good WiFi, I recommend <a href="https://www.smarthostels.com/hyde-park-view">Hyde Park View.</a> You will have free breakfast if you book directly with them. If you book via an agency, you have to pay for it.</p>

      <h2>Other Advice</h2>

      <p>If you are lost or need some help or advice, ask a policeman, he will always help you.  When addressing a policeman, the correct English is "excuse me constable" or "excuse me sergeant" as the case may be. The emergency number is 999. If you dial this number, you will be asked: "Which service please?" You answer: "fire" "police" "ambulance" or "coast guard." If you are in West Wales, don't wait for an ambulance, call a taxi! Ambulance waiting time is up to 3 hours!</p>

      <h2>Health Care</h2>

      <p>If you become ill, go to your nearest NHS (National Health Service) hospital A&E (Accident and Emergency department) and expect to wait a long time to be treated: take some food and drink with you. It is unlikely that you will be charged for the care you receive unless it is something really major.  If you are from an EU country, it is free regardless. Dental care is expensive in the UK, so make sure your teeth are in good condition before you come here. Although EU citizens may be entitled to free NHS dental care, finding an NHS dentist is a nightmare. You will almost certainly have to pay privately.</p> 

      <h2>Crime</h2>

      <p>Unfortunately, violent crime has increased significantly in recent years, especially in the cities, with London overtaking New York for violent crime. Whenever you are in a big city, remember to stay in the tourist areas which are will policed and covered with security cameras. Don't get too concerned over this point, just be cautious. Remember most of this type of crime is not targeted at tourists.</p> 

      <h2>Tax-Free Shopping</h2>

      <p>Most goods in the United Kingdom have a 20% tax included in the price. If you are not a UK resident, you can, in some cases, claim this money back. You must be a non-EU resident, over 18 years of age, and have the properly completed paperwork from the shop you purchased the goods from. This is true for all over the EU, for further details, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/individuals/travelling/travellers-leaving-eu/guide-vat-refund-visitors-eu_en">click here.</a></p>
