		<h1>A Summary of The Five Conditionals</h1>														
		<p>Conditionals are constructed from two clauses:</p>
		<p>An "if" clause (antecedent).</p>
		<p>and</p>
		<p>A "consequence clause."</p>				
		<p>“If” may sometimes be replaced with “as long as,” “unless,” “provided that,”  “should” or “were.”</p>
		<p>It does not matter which clause comes first. However, if the "if" clause comes first, the clauses must be separated by a comma.</p>			
        <h2>Zero Conditional</h2>				
		<p>"If you enter the water, you get wet” - indisputable fact - present simple (regular action).</p>							
		<h2>First Conditional</h2>						
   	    <p>“If I earn some money, I will spend it” - possible, probable, likely event (future).</p> 				
		<h2>Second Conditional</h2>												
		<p>"If I won the lottery, I would travel around the world" - very unlikely, wishful thinking (future).</p>
		<p>"If I had wings, I could fly" - hypothetical, impossible (present).</p>  
		<h2>Third Conditional</h2>				
		<p>“If I had earned some money, I would have spent it” - imaginary situation in the past.</p>								
		<h2>Mixed Conditional</h2>		 									
		<p>"If I had studied harder, I would have a good job now” - the "if" clause is in the past and the consequence is in the present. <br>(There are several types of mixed conditional, this is the simplest and enough for up to level 7.5).<br><br></p>
		<p>An explanation of zero, first, second and third conditional in Russian can be found <a href="https://speakenglishwell.ru/predlozheniya-s-if-v-anglijskom-yazyke/">here.</a></p>  						
  		<p>For a more detailed look at mixed conditionals (level 8 and 9), <a href="https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-grammar/mixed-conditional/">click here.</a></p>
  		<p><b>Tip: Use conditionals in both the IELTS writing and speaking tests to help fulfill the flexible use of grammar criterion.</b></p>
