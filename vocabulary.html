            <h1>Vocabulary for IELTS</h1>
            <p>Here is a list of English words to learn for IELTS. They are in order of frequency of use, starting with the most frequently used.</p>	    
            <p> Note: there is no official IELTS word list, and the bands are just an approximate: you are advised to learn as many words as you can!</p>

            <p>You will find it useful to obtain a copy of <b>"Russian Learner's Dictionary: 10 000 Russian words in Frequency Order by Nicholas J Brown."</b> Although this book is intended for English learners of Russian, you can use it in reverse with ease.</p>
            <p>If targeting band 7 and above, you are also advised to click on the link below and learn all the words under the title <b>Advanced Vocabulary Lists and Exercises</b>, then complete the section <b>Cloze Exercises at the bottom of the sheet.</b> <a href="http://www.eflnet.com/vocab/advanced_vocabulary.php">Click here</a></p>

            <h1>Memrise</h1>
            <p>The Memrise flashcard system is one of the best space-repetition programs for memorising vocabulary, based on scientifically proven methods of memory training. I highly recommend you use this system to learn vocabulary. There is usually a free trial period but you must pay for a subscription after that. However, in my view, it is worth it.</p>
