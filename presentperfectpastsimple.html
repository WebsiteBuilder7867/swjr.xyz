      <h1>Present Perfect and Past Simple</h1>
      <h2>Present Perfect Tense</h2>
      <p>Lets first revise the meaning of the term “present perfect.”</p>
      <p>The PRESENT PERFECT TIME PERIOD refers to time periods which lead up to, just before, or just into the present. For example: ever, never, until now, for the last three years, since I was a child.</p>
      <p>NOTE: do not confuse time periods with tenses. Time periods are associated with time, tenses are associated with verbs - a clear understanding of the difference is essential to understanding how to use English verbs correctly.</p>
      <p>I have sang the song. - focuses on the completion of an action during the present perfect time period.
      I have washed the car. - emphasis on the completion (and hence also the obvious but unspoken result - the car is clean).</p>
      <p>The present perfect tense therefore expresses that an action has been completed during the present perfect time period and if there is a result, usually states or implies it.</p>
      <p>We do not have to state when the action took place because the present perfect is the default tense. However, if we do state it, it is always in present time, the time in which we now live. See above.</p>
      <h2>Past Simple Tense</h2>
      <p>The PAST TIME PERIOD, in a grammatical sense, is the period of time which has expired, which no longer exists and in which we do not live. For example, yesterday, last month, last year, in Soviet times, when I was a child, in 1922 etc.</p>
      <p>When we use the past simple tense, we must be sure that our interlocutor knows that we are talking about an action which took place in the past. Therefore, if he does not already know, we must state or imply when the action took place.</p>
      <p>I went shopping yesterday (Past stated - yesterday).</p>
      <p>Dostoyevsky wrote "Igrok." (Dostoyevsky died many years ago, so the past is implied).</p>
