	  <h1>Articles</h1>

	  <p><b>Important: whenever you use a noun or a gerund, ask yourself whether or not you should use an article.</b><br><br></p>

    <p>“The,” is the definite article and indicates a <b>specific</b> subject or object.<br>  
    This is the cat that drank the milk = we know which cat and we know which milk.</p>

    <p>“A” is the indefinite article and indicates a <b>non-specific</b>, countable subject or object.<br>
    A cat drank the milk = we don’t know which cat, but we do know which milk.</p>

    <p>The absence of an article indicates a generality.<br>
    Cats drink milk = cats, in general, drink milk.</p>
    <p>Note; in the above examples, milk is understood to be a saucer or milk or a bowl of milk, hence countable.</p>

    <br></p>

    <p><b>Gerunds:</b> don't usually require articles, and never use "a."<br>
