	    <h1>Basic Sentence Structure</h1>
	    <p>Sentences are made up of clauses, a clause consists of a subject, verb and object in that order.</p>
      <h2>A simple sentence is made up of one clause.</h2>
      <p>Subject = I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Verb = bought &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object = car</p>
      <h2>A complex sentence is made up of at least two clauses.</h2>
      <h3>Sentences Consisting of a Main Clause and a Subordinate Clause.</h3> 
      <p>A subordinate clause usually elucidates (further describes or explains) the the main clause in some way.
	    It is usually joined to the main clause by a subordinate conjunction.</p>
      <p>I bought a car but I wanted a horse.<br><br></p>
      <p>Main Clause, = I bought a car</p>
      <p>Subordinate conjunction = but</p>
      <p>Subordinate Clause = I wanted a horse</p>
      <h3>Sentences Consisting of Two Clauses of Equal Importance</h3>
      <p>Some sentences are made up of two clauses of equal importance and are connected by a simple conjunction.</p>
      <p>I bought an ice cream and went for a walk.</p>
      <p>The second clause is not a consequence or a description of the first, so a simple conjunction such as “and” is appropriate here.<br><br></p>
      <h3>Sentences Consisting of Two Clauses With the Conjunction Brought to the Front.</h3>
      <p>Conjunctions are sometimes brought to the front for emphasis, for example: “When I play football (<i>and I rarely do</i>), I like to play in the position of striker.” 
	    A comma is usually placed between the clauses when the conjunction is taken to the front.</p>    
	    <h2>Sentence Length</h2>
      <p>Try to keep your sentences short, no longer than two or three clauses.</p>
      <h1>Lists</h1>
      <p>I bought some coffee, sugar, milk, tea and sandwiches. No comma before "and."  However, when I was in school, we were told to always use one in this position.  It was called the "Oxford Comma," so you may find it in some older texts.</p>
      <p>I bought coffee, sugar, milk, sandwiches, crisps, and, fish and chips.  Here I have used a comma after the first "and."  This is because the fish and chips were purchased together as one item.</p> 
      <p>It is also possible to use colons and semi-colons to separate items in a long list. For ielts purposes, avoid this as there seem to be no really consistent rules.</p>
      <h1>Definite and Indefinite Article</h1>
      <p>Remember to use “a” and “the.”  This is a major problem, as English is one of the few languages that use articles, the majority of students forget to check that they have included them. There is an explanation and some online practice exercises in the Grammar section of this site.</p>
      <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
      <p>Remember to use paragraphs and that every letter and essay has an introduction and a conclusion with a separate paragraph for each item discussed.</p> 
      <h1>Verbs</h1>		
      <h2>Active or Passive?</h2>
      <p>The active voice is more frequently used than the passive voice in English – use active whenever possible.</p>
      <h2>Base Tense</h2>
      <p>When writing, make sure you are using the correct base tense and are consistent.  
	    For example: a historical essay would be written in the past simple, although you may need to use other tenses for specific parts, you should return to the past simple as soon as possible.</p>  
      <p>Example: When Napoleon was the emperor of France, he conquered almost all of Europe and expanded the French Empire. However, France is now just an ordinary EU country. 
      In this essay, I will describe how Napoleon conquered Europe and how the French Empire rose and fell.<br> 
      Napoleon was born in.............fought at Austerlitz........was defeated at Waterloo etc.</p>
      <h1>Read a lot!</h1>
      <p>Read a lot to enhance your grammar knowledge.  Students who do a lot of reading often subconsciously “know” the appropriate word to use together with the associated grammar.</p>
